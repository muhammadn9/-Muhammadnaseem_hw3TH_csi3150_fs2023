            Your Bears, trains and Icebergs adventures starts with a scenic ride

            from the Anchorage Depot located at 411 West First Avenue at 9:45am.
            After traveling through the anchorage you will descend through the
            Anchorage Coastal Wildlife Refuge.

          <p class="W2W">What to wear</p>
          <p>
            In Alaska, dressing in layers is the key to staying comfortable. The
            weather can be quite variable, so pack clothing that can adapt to
            changing conditions. A warm, waterproof jacket, insulated boots, and
            moisture-wicking base layers are essential. Don't forget accessories
            like gloves and a hat. Even in the summer, temperatures can
            fluctuate, so be prepared for chilly mornings and potentially warmer
            afternoons. And if you plan on exploring the great outdoors,
            reliable rain gear is a must to keep you dry during unexpected
            showers.

          <p class="Res">Reservations</p>
          <p>
            When planning a trip to Alaska, it's advisable to make reservations
            for accommodations, activities, and tours well in advance,
            especially during the peak tourist season from May to September.
            This ensures you secure your desired lodging and activities, which
            can fill up quickly. Whether you're booking a cozy cabin in the
            wilderness, a guided wildlife tour, or a scenic train ride,
            reserving ahead of time is the best way to guarantee a smooth and
            enjoyable Alaskan adventure. Be flexible with your travel dates, as
            it can increase your chances of securing reservations and allow you
            to fully experience the incredible beauty and activities that Alaska
            has to offer.
